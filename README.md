# No fog of war

This mod removes the Fog of War system in Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord, making all settlements and characters permanently visible in the in-game encyclopedia. No more guessing who controls which fief or where a wandering lord disappeared to—everything is instantly accessible.

The mod is fully customizable through the **MCM (Mod Configuration Menu)**. Players can choose to:

* Reveal *only settlements*,
* Reveal *only characters*,
* Or enable visibility for *both* at the same time.

Total flexibility, full control.
Additionally, the mod makes **no changes to save files**, meaning it can be installed or uninstalled at any time without risk. Your campaign stays perfectly safe.

Localization support for: BR,DE,FR,IT,PL,RU,SP,TR
